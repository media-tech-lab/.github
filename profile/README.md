## Hey, we are the Media Tech Lab 👋

![Media Tech Lab Header image](/assets/mtl-bg.jpg)

You are an open source developer or software freelancer? You are passionate about an innovative IT topic that could help the media industry? You have identified a tech problem for which there is no solution yet? If so, the Media Tech Lab is just right for you! Every research and development project that gets lost in the daily editorial routine, for which there is no money, or which simply no longer fits into the annual plan of a media company, is all the more exciting for us.
